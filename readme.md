# Video Instructor Tryout

Check out the [Instructor Tryout Guide](https://www.raywenderlich.com/video-team-guide/instructor-tryout), if you haven't done so already.

This repo contains everything you need to complete Phase 1 of your Instructor Tryout. 

* Choose one of the screencasts from the **iOS or Android Materials** folders to record for your tryout. 
* The script file will contain the scripts for the on-camera and demo parts of each screencast. 
* If one is included, use the **Starter** project as the starting point for your demo recordings.

# References

For your reference, we've included the book chapter the iOS screencast series was based on, so you can see how a chapter or tutorial may be split up into multiple screencasts. 

To see what a finished screencast looks like, you can watch Brian Moakley's recording of the [first Dynamic Type screencast](https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses/138-dynamic-type/lessons/1) or Joe Howard's recording of the [Jetpack: Navigation Controller screencast](https://videos.raywenderlich.com/screencasts/1808-jetpack-navigation-controller).
